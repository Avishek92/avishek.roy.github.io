# About me

I'm a physiologist by academic training, my research interests include synaptic, behavioral and circuit level alteration in neurodegeneration like Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Alzheimer's is known to characterized by extracellular amyloid plaque and intracellular neurofibrillary tangle deposition in brain parenchyma. Which is implicated with patient's cognitive impairment and have direct association with synaptic dysfunction. My present role is to unravel the synaptic machinery for 4r tauopathies and progressive supranuclear palsy in cortical and subcortical circuitry. This is a work that is being funded by Alzheimer's Association International at department of Neurobiology Care Sciences and Society, division of clinical geriatrics, Karolinska Institute with [Dr Amit Kumar](https://ki.se/en/people/amit-kumar). 
I had previously worked with [Dr Christophe Mulle](https://iins.u-bordeaux.fr/MULLE#mem) in the team Synapses and Neural Circuits in Behaviour at IINS (UMR5297), Bordeaux Neurocampus. My role was to unravel the morpho-funcational role of genetic [risk factor phospholipase gamma 2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.29.591575v1) in AD. My PhD thesis investigated the role of non-invasive brain stimulation in animal model of AD. Thesis title: [‘‘A morphological and functional study on intracerebroventricular streptozotocin induced rat model of Alzheimer’s disease: Effect of magnetic field stimulation’’](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VkDu9nESils6-hkmQ4U6h1sPO3TrY1Mg/view?usp=drive_link). This work was conducted in Neurophysiology and nano-medicine lab with [Dr Suman Jain](https://www.aiims.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=669&Itemid=1502&lang=en) in All India Institute for Medical Sciences, New Delhi.

# Work experiences
- In a short project supported by short term studentship and student fellowship & skill development scheme by ICMR & DBT respectively I have looked into the potential to generate and incorporate new neurons in adult network of adult hippocampus of animals that has been exposed to extremely low intensity and low frequency magnetic field (sinusoidal, 17.96µT, 50Hz). In this project I've not only learnt the mechanism of action of magnetic field stimulation directly affecting the [cognition through manipulation of adult born circuitry](https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/52/Supplement_1/afac322.037/6987738?login=true), but also got chance to guide two brilliant students.
  
- I've worked in an individual senior research fellowship program vide.45/5/2019-PHY/BMS from Indian Council of Medical Sciences at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi from April 2019-2022 in project entitled as “Effect of Chronic Exposure to Low Intensity Magnetic Field on Streptozotocin Induced Synaptic Dysfunction and Amyloid Precursor Protein Processing in Rats' where co-PIs were Dr Suman Jain & Dr Jyotirmoy Banerjee. The idea of the project was to investigate the [alteration to the dendritic architecture](https://www.brainstimjrnl.com/article/S1935-861X(21)00379-X/fulltext) of the CA1 pyramidal layers of hippocampus injected with streptozotocin supported with the electrophysiological correlates of synaptic inputs with/ without sinusoidal magnetic field stimulation.
  
- From April 2022-2024 I had worked on the morpho-functional correlates of the genetic risk factors of Alzheimer's disease in a project with acronym [GENSYNALZ from](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.29.591575v1) AAPG scheme from The French National Research Agency (ANR). This project is to develop tools to test the Alzheimer's risk genes in organotypic as well as acute slices to link morpho-functional relationship using transfection, microscopic and electrophysiological tools. Genes that we are targeting has been already funneled down with GWAS as well as preliminary through multi-electrode-array recordings on dissociated neuronal culture.


# Expertise
I work with acute slices from brains of animals transfected with AD risk genes. Therefore, I conduct single cell electroporation experiments, use viral tools for transfect neurons of choice. Recent electrophysiological experiments provide me to understand the intrinsic properties of granule cells of dentate gyrus (DG). And also, to understand the dynamics of perforant pathway-DG synaptic circuitry. Apart from electrophysiology my other responsibilities include morphological analysis of the DG cells both at dendritic as well as at spine level. To do so, I use multiple imaging platforms viz. wide-field, (epi)fluorescence and confocal microscopy.

And then for analysis I use Igor pro, Neuromatic, open-ephy-python-tool for Ephys and FIJI, Imaris, NeuroStudio and others for imaging experiments.    

Previously, I used to do cognitive tasks with rodents. Also, microinjection through stereotaxic surgeries in brain areas (like hippocampus, lateral ventricles, hypothalamus etc.). Further, I did different histological tools (Nissl, Golgi-COX, Congo-red) including immunostaining for sub-cellular localization of proteins, biochemicals tools (ELISA, western blot), 1H-NMR, transmission electron microscopy.

During this period I came across different softwares related to the aforementioned tools like Ethovision XT, AnyMaze, FIJI, Neurolucida, Neurolucida-explorer, Mnova, TopSpin, Espina, webknoss, python, SPSS, graphpad etc.
